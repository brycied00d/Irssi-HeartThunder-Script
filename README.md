Irssi HeartThunder Script
=========================

I originally wrote this script to make #<3thunder dead-simple. Any message you send in #<3thunder will be appropriately spaced and prefixed with the 15-length(nick) and <3 thunder.

If you have problems, open an issue (or fork/patch/pull-request) :)


Footnote
--------
For more information, specifically on what "<3 thunder" means, its origins, and silly little things like that, please consult the XKCD wiki: http://wiki.xkcd.com/irc/Heart_Thunder
